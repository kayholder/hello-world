# hello-world
a girl who is new to coding
Hello my name is Kayla, and I have always been excited about the idea of coding, but I have never taken the plunge. When I learned that CODE Kentucky is now in the bluegrass! Did I say I was excited? In my free time I love to read, spend time with my friends and family, and I also love going to basketball games! (Typical Kentuckian, I know). I would love the opportunity to travel more and like this class, try new experiences and not be afraid to chase my dreams!
